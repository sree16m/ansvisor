 * Builds the in-product agent's LLM with the caller-supplied API key.
 *
 * We can't export a singleton model anymore — on cloud each org brings its
 * own Anthropic key (Settings → Agent), so the key is request-scoped. The
 * chat route resolves the key per turn via `resolveAnthropicKey(orgId)`
 * and hands it to this builder; self-host passes the operator's env key.
 *
 * Model choice (claude-sonnet-5) matches the tracking flow's Claude
 * option so behavior + cost shape stay consistent across the product.
